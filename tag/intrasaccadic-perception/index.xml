      <title>Coupling perception to action through incidental sensory consequences of motor behaviour</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This perspective paper is dedicated to the question how an active perceptual system deals with the sensory consequences of its own actions. For instance, in the field of active vision little is known about the consequences of large-field smear induced by the rapid image shift caused by saccades. Whereas such information is thought to hinder visual processing, new evidence is discussed that sheds light on the intriguing possibility of action-perception couplings, that is, the idea that perception is shaped by sensory consequences of actions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intrasaccadic motion streaks jump-start gaze correction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this piece we showed that the visual traces that moving objects induce during saccades can facilitate secondary saccades in both accuracy and saccade initiation latency. Secondary saccades are typically prompted when one saccade does not entirely reach a target or when the saccade target is displaced in mid-flight. Our results provide evidence against the widely acknowledged notion that our brains preemptively discard visual information which reaches the eye during saccades. The paper has received some peer and media attention, such as a well-written &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abk0043&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;commentary by Jasper Fabius and Stefan van der Stigchel&lt;/a&gt;, as well as articles in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02058-9&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nature Research Highlights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aaas.org/news/human-eyes-absorb-visual-information-even-during-rapid-eye-movements&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AAAS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2285131-we-thought-our-eyes-turned-off-when-moving-quickly-but-thats-wrong/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vozpopuli.com/next/ojos-movimientos-sacadicos.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vozp√≥puli&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://rolfslab.org/2021/08/09/press-coverage-on-science-advances-paper/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the Rolfslab&#39;s blog post&lt;/a&gt; for the full list).

      <title>Perceptual and Motor Consequences of Intra-saccadic Perception</title>
      <link>https://richardschweitzer.github.io/publication/schweitzer2020_dissertation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is intra-saccadic vision merely an epiphenomenon or could visual information that reaches the eye during saccades be used by the visual system? That was the question of my cumulative doctoral dissertation, which features not only a synopsis of all studies conducted up to this point, but also a review of the saccadic-suppression and motion-streak literature to put these findings into context. The dissertation has been awarded two prizes &amp;ndash; the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hu-berlin.de/de/ueberblick/menschen/ehrungen/humboldtpreis/archiv/humboldt-preis-2021/perceptual-and-motor-consequences-of-intra-saccadic-perception&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Humboldt Prize&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.studienstiftung.de/pressemitteilungen/artikel/studienstiftung-vergibt-promotionspreise-2022-1/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lieselotte Pongratz-Promotionspreis&lt;/a&gt; by Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes (see also the &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Q6lAIwXfRVQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;short movie&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intra-saccadic motion streaks as cues to linking object locations across saccades</title>
      <link>https://richardschweitzer.github.io/publication/schweitzerrolfs2020_jov/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever we make a saccade to an object, that object will travel from the periphery to the fovea at extremely high velocities. Depending on the visual features of the object, such motion can induce streaks, that may serve as visual clues to solve the problem of trans-saccadic object correspondence. Using a high-speed projection system operating at 1440 fps, we investigated to what extent human observers are capable of matching pre- and post-saccadic object locations when their only cue was an intra-saccadic motion streak, and compared their performance during saccades to a replay of the retinal stimulus trajectory presented during fixation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A toolbox for parsing Eyelink EDF files was implemented in R to analyze this series of experiments, which can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/richardschweitzer/EyelinkEDFTools_R&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An adaptive algorithm for fast and reliable online saccade detection</title>
      <link>https://richardschweitzer.github.io/publication/schweitzerrolfs2020_brm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To study intrasaccadic vision, we need stimulus manipulations that occur strictly during saccades. Due to the brief durations of saccades, this can prove a difficult task, as various system latencies (eye tracker, refresh cycle, video delay, and some more) have to be considered. While most of these delays are hardware-dependent, one opportunity to alleviate timing issues in gaze-contingent eye-tracking paradigms is applying an efficient online saccade detection! In this paper we described such an algorithm, validated it in simulations and experiments, and made it &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/richardschweitzer/OnlineSaccadeDetection&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;publicly available&lt;/a&gt;) so that it can be used with a range of different programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Joy of Retinal Painting: A Build-It-Yourself Device for Intrasaccadic Presentations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows this nice party trick: Try to observe your own rapid eye movements (so-called saccades) in the mirror &amp;ndash; and realize that you will not be able to. Despite this striking example, we are not blind during saccades. This paper features a demonstration (as well as schematics and code to built it yourself) that is capable of producing highly salient, nicely resolvable stimuli which can only be perceived during saccades!&lt;/p&gt;
