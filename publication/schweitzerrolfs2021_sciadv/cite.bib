abstract = {Rapid eye movements entail retinal motion streaks that provide spatiotemporal continuity of objects and guide gaze correction. Rapid eye movements (saccades) incessantly shift objects across the retina. To establish object correspondence, the visual system is thought to match surface features of objects across saccades. Here, we show that an object’s intrasaccadic retinal trace—a signal previously considered unavailable to visual processing—facilitates this match making. Human observers made saccades to a cued target in a circular stimulus array. Using high-speed visual projection, we swiftly rotated this array during the eyes’ flight, displaying continuous intrasaccadic target motion. Observers’ saccades landed between the target and a distractor, prompting secondary saccades. Independently of the availability of object features, which we controlled tightly, target motion increased the rate and reduced the latency of gaze-correcting saccades to the initial presaccadic target, in particular when the target’s stimulus features incidentally gave rise to efficient motion streaks. These results suggest that intrasaccadic visual information informs the establishment of object correspondence and jump-starts gaze correction.}}
